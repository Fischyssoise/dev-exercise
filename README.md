Front-end Dev Exercise Reflections:

I started this project with a goal of getting more comfortable with git workflows as well as using the opportunity to better understand the functionality of DOM interfaces and css flexbox styling elements. I had also not used VS Code very thouroughly as an IDE prior to this project, so becoming more familiar with its functionality was important as well.

In terms of accomplishing these goals, I feel that I was fairly successful. I had not used querySelectors eventListeners much prior to this project. Understanding them was vital to the functionality of the application, but they were difficult to completely wrap my head around at first. The flexbox styling was more of a challenge as I struggled at first to understand some of the parent-child relationalships between the different attributes. I hope to explore the possibilities of flexbox more in the future because I really only scratched the surface here. In terms of building the HTML, I struggled with finding the right balance between div and lists elements as well as what was nested in each. I ended up finding ways to simplify things in many cases, but it was a lot of trial and error that I hope to avoid in the future. This was also the case for my use of element IDs versus classes. I realized that I was overusing IDs when building my initial framework, and going back through my scripts and styles to refactor many of my ID calls to classes was very time consuming.

While this exercise took me much longer than I initially anticipated, it provided me with a better sense of how to set and manage expectations. The app I pictured in my head included many more features, but I was eventually able to acknowledge the importance of prioritizing the project's explicit requirements since even building "simpler" tools requires plenty of time and effort if you want to do it well the first time. As a less-experienced programmer, it is of course important for me to take the time to learn and experiment, but if I were starting this exercise over, I would choose to set and prioritize more goals related to meeting project requirements, communicating with the "client," and delivering it in a timely manner.

One last thing I wanted to call out is recognizing how insecure this application would be in its current state. I understand the importance of storing and retrieving data securely, but am not very experienced in implementing best practices for this.
